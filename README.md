# Advent of Code

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.


Each challenge is kept in a separate directory.
Each directory contains the challenge's input and solution.
Solutions are executable. Execute them from within the challenge's directory.

`./new` prepares a new directory and a source file based on a template.

```sh
./new 2019 8 py             # prepare a new directory (python template)
cd 2019/08
mv ~/downloads/input.txt .  # add the input
editor solution.py          # code the solution
./solution.py
```
